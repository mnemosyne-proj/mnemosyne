Minor bugs / issues:

-editing a tag by clicking in the tree does not get saved
-tree expansion status does not get saved
- wheelock anki deck:
  - where does div on import appear? e.g. numerus
  - searching for div turns up wrong results?
  - empty ()
- checking for unused tags scales badly when deleting 1500 cards
- can result in deleting same tag twice?
-Are the configuration settings properly synced?
-Delete current card which is sentence card with only a sentence field does not
 seem to work.
-Adding the "enabled" tag does not automatically get rid of the cross-out in the
 card browser.
-Prevent commas in tag names also when using 'create_new_cards' in script.
-Incoming sync when card browser is open does not work.
-Add cloze from card browser, preview does not update correctly
 to show new number of cards
-For Latex on OSX: try and have OSX search system paths, or otherwise edit config.py
 latex = "/Library/TeX/texbin/latex -output-format=dvi -interaction=nonstopmode"
 dvipng = "/Library/TeX/texbin/dvipng -D 200 -T tight tmp.dvi"
-Anki: Q and A align top, no boundaries around content: document how to add CSS
 to fix this?
-sometimes scheduled counter goes negative? Hard to reproduce...
-migrate sync server / web server / sync dialog to qt_worker_thread
 infrastructure.
-strip HTML when doing rlt check?
-decrease size of installer by seeing if more libraries can be removed.
-example plugin for new learning modes
-update dev instructions linux, windows
-run tests in different threads
-make sure initial settings are synced using binary sync.
-keeping a key pressed after 'grade answer' proceeds to show the question
-RTL still does not work for first cloze, in the case the sentence is more than
 1 line
 http://dotancohen.com/howto/rtl_right_to_left.html
-after sync, a cloze card type displays all hints
-sister card not automatically updated when pg-dwn through card browser
-"A <audio> B" displays only "A"
-test if initial sync on Android download archive files download, using a custom
 dot_test directory
-merge and edit dialog: if the cards contain too much info, the window is so
 large that the buttons are not visible.
-edit card to update a media file, sync with 'check for updated media files on
 client fails'
-server.py imports from libmnemosyne.utils
-import/export dialog alignment does not look nice
-Select saved set, switch tab to other criterion (deselects set) and switch
 back to original one.The set should then be autoselected again.
-layout of "add clone" is not optimal under Windows
-select saved set, delete that set: set name is still visible in windows header
-sync of changed saved set does not update title on target machine
-creating a new clone does not generate appearance setting events for sync
-Related: create a new cardtype through *.cards import, setting font, does not
 seem to sync across?
-if the sync changed the appearance settings, the current card's question still
 shows the old appearance
-sync failed because of version mismatch seems to result in requirement for
 full sync?
-note: sync from a to b and then to c adds latex files to the media table. Is
 this aproblem? Can the table become corrupt?
-heartbeat in headless server: if a sync request comes in while this is running,
 it will fail because of threading issues.
-Michael Campbell: I changed the background color of Mnemosyne to something
 other than white, and I noticed that it uses that color when adding new
 content. However, when that window does not have focus, it turns white again.
-tag on client, same tag on server, then sync.
 Tag names get renamed, but original tag is set inactive.
-cloze deletion in combination with latex or html does not pick up any open
 environments
-don't switch to text entry field when changing card type with the keys.
-when the server thread hangs and the main program is terminated, the cleanup
 code gets called from the main thread as opposed to from the server thread,
 and will therefore fail. (The server thread should release its connection
 itself)
-if last card had unequal split, learn ahead of schedule message does not go
 back to 50/50 split.
-webserver: map card type does not really hide the question box, just blanks the
 question
-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... >
-move button group in review widget to designer code after pyqt upgrade.
 Also possible in add cards?
*These were all reported using Qt4, and probably no longer apply:
-Qt bug? different font size in edit box and in css
-Qt bug? Cannot restore scroll_to column in card browser after tag rename.
-Qt bug? Cntl+a select all in card browser only selects all the prefetched
 entries
-Qt bug? insertAtTop on tags combobox in add_cards does not seem to work
-Qt bug? cursor is always black, also on a black background
 https://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-52
-Qt bug? error dialogs don't allow copying the text from it on all platforms
-Qt bug? svg Mnemosyne watermark for tip and getting started does not work under
 Linux
-Qt bug? review widget: frame.scroll does not seem to work reliably for PageUp
-Qt bug? clicking on web widget in preview dialog eats escape keypress
-Qt bug? QGraphicsWebView.loadFinished sometimes fires before images are loaded?
-Qt bug? bulleted lists: bullets are always aligned left, not centered:
Milesteiner
<ul><li>Focuses 20 to 30cm away</li>
  <li>Eyes wander and occasionally cross</li>
</ul>
-Qt bug? text + linebreak + video + linebreak + text2 does not show text2
-Qt bug? Windows titles not shown?
-Qt bug? When setting Arial as initial font to the FontDialog, it is always
 made bold.
-Qt bug? In default_criterion_widget, need to reinitialise text of label
-Qt bug? When installing the translator, need to reset window title manually.
-Qt bug? keypressEvent for 'yet to learn' works for enter, return, y, but not
 0 or 1.
-Qt bug? main_widget.set_window_title seems to work only if no title was
 defined in the ui file.
-Qt bug? cannot define sq escape character to search for literal _
-Qt bug? Kanji does not scale, but latin does
  åŽ³é‡?ã?ªè­¦æˆ’<span style="font-size:24pt;">test åŽ³é‡?ã?ªè­¦æˆ’</span>
-Qt bug
1. Add new card
2. Enter "test" on front
3. Enter "« test »" (alt+174, alt+175) on back
The card gets closed the moment one has hit the alt+..5 key and a new card is
created with just the "»" symbol.
-Qt bug: enabling word wrap on tag label breaks setting of stretch factors in
 q and a
-Qt issue: toggling a tag in the card browser using 'space' does not update the
 card list. Catched itemChanged instead of itemClicked would solve this in
 theory, but this would cause a lot of spurious updates if you toggle the parent
 of a big hierarchy. ItemActivated only seems to catch double clicks
-Qt issue: font size is rounded up to the nearest default integer in font
 selection dialog.
-component_manager:deactivate_all: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-52988
-tag browser editor of tag names does not capture focus out event, so card
 count is not redrawn.
-Qt performance problem with selectRow
-Qt bug: cntro-Tabbing to different windows eats keyboard shortcuts: *-Tab to
 "Current card", *-Tab stops working and the Statistics window will not close
 with Escape.

-flake8



Other features:

- switch to PyOxidizer when it supports PyQt?

- plugin to deactivate cards in a certain cardtype after X retention reps.

-check for required fields when using the Anki card type.

-first doing a count and then the actual a query is not a good idea:?
time 'number_of_log_entries_to_sync_for' vs 'number_of_log_entries'

-don't generate card edited logs when importing a card and no change occurs
 in a card
  #if (eval(log_entry["extra"]) == orig_card.extra_data) && \
  # tags, unless extra tags on import
  # card type
  # factview
  # Important: fact,
media, tag (check all 'already_imported' statements)


-status bar: scheduled: x / not memorised: x / goal new cards: x/y
-new cards goal can overshoot, e.g. 7/5
-save state upon exit, reset at midnight
-config: goal_new_cards, new_cards_today
-Android

Other learning modes:
-add 'difficult' tag, and add 'cram difficult?'
-mixture of learn new / cram recent?
   -config: cram recent: X days, only new cards vs new + relearned cards,
    ratio between new and recent
   -for 'cramming' cards, show yes/no buttons instead of 0-5
    as visual indicator
   -log that the card is crammed
   -Unify review controllers and widgets, taking cramming buttons into account?
-forgotten only?

-generate end message for new learning modes. (learn ahead of schedule is not
always relevant)

-settings in config.py don't play well with syncing: if the user does not
 update config.py on the target machine as well, these settings will get reset
 by the default config.py there. So, get rid of config.py and move it to an
 advanced settings plugin?

-activate cards: 'having any of these tags:' is not aligned with tag with tag
 tree

-command line switch for headless server not to check for updated card types.

-option to move dividers in edit field (e.g. for large font sizes)

-for the sentence card type without hints, use the 'meaning' font for Q in
 production, instead of the sentence font?

-optimisation: change card type for many facts which calls
 'delete_facts_and_their_data' does checking for unused tags multiple times.

-fine tuning: when merging a database, merge also the 'active' tag instead of
 just looking at the deactivated fact views? Probably more general and also
 more future proof in case of new criteria.

 check if it's at all possible to convert (enough fields), before showing
 correspondence dialog.

Multiuser statistics analysis:

-break out card id strings to a different table and use integer _id in the
 rest of the database to save space
-move times from a later start date to save space?
-investigate origin of ._ logs
-don't do card checks for post 2.0


Design warts:

- config storage, is now scattered over 3 places (config.db, config.py,
  database.db). At least config.py should go and be replaced by an
  advanced settings menu. Document a standard way for plugins to
  save settings. Rework everything better in the sync protocol.
  Other issue related to storage is that built-in CardTypes like Sentence cannot store extra_data, so we resorted to e.g.
  storing the language info in config.db
- related: config().card_type_property(): refactor to be members of card_type as
  opposed to of config.py
