The files to study when writing a new client based on the embedded C server
are the following:

example_client.c: shows how to interact with libmnemosyne through C
main_wdgt.c/h, review_wdgt.c/h, dlgs.c/h: these are the functions that 
    libmnemosyne's UI controllers will call
python_stdout_stderr.c/h: captures stdout and stderr written to
     from Python

Note that Unicode strings are encoded in UTF-8.

The files above are now implemented in C, but could be implemented in any
language that allows linking to python_bridge.o and libpython.a, e.g.
ObjC.
