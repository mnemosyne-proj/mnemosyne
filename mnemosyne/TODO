Make sure review widget gets reset appropriately

Merge review controllers, also take cramming buttons into account
For 'cramming' cards, show yes/no buttons instead of 0-5 as visual indicator
log that the card is crammed

Learning mode menu:
-learn new / cram recent: new scheduler
-cram recent: same new scheduler, but setting 'new' to zero

Each learning mode separate config widget?

Mode with forgotten only?

Generate end message for new learning modes. (learn ahead of schedule is not 
always relevant)

GUI Config: 
- cram recent: X days, only new cards vs new + relearned cards
- learn new / cram recent: ratio between new and recent

example plugin for new learning modes


-status bar: scheduled: x / not memorised: x / goal new cards: x/y
-new cards goal can overshoot, e.g. 7/5
-save state upon exit, reset at midnight 
-config: goal_new_cards, new_cards_today

-hold in your hand --> work on at most 'X' non memorised cards. 
 Rephrase tips, docs
 
-Android GUI: menu, new status bar

-later: add 'difficult' tag, and add 'cram difficult?'

-delay when using keyboard shortcuts


-for sync, check only database version, not program version

-update dev instructions linux, windows
 
-Note: high DPI on Mac (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/highdpi.html) is enabled by 
 settings in the Info.plist file.

Android:

-check 'redraw now'
-decrease size of python library
-precompile python files
-pybridge: don't extract individual assets but extract zip file? Faster?
-setting to allow choosing the database location?\
-revisit multiple database option?
-'sync' button should sync directly without going through the sync settings 
 dialog. Put the settings in a settings window instead.

-make sure Android uploads logs as well
-set default grade?
-plugin to hide card, i.e. no longer show it?
-video
-gestures?
-option to globally increase / decrease font size with respect to desktop
-custom fonts?


Minor bugs:

-keeping a key pressed after 'grade answer' proceeds to show the question
-RTL still does not work for first cloze, in the case the sentence is more than
 1 line
 http://dotancohen.com/howto/rtl_right_to_left.html
-after sync, a cloze card type displays all hints
-sister card not automatically updated when pg-dwn through card browser
-"A <audio> B" displays only "A"
-test if initial sync on Android download archive files download, using a custom
 dot_test directory
-edit card to update a media file, sync with 'check for updated media files on
 client fails'
-server.py imports from libmnemosyne.utils
-import/export dialog alignment does not look nice
-Select saved set, switch tab to other criterion (deselects set) and switch 
 back to original one.The set should then be autoselected again.
-layout of "add clone" is not optimal under Windows
-select saved set, delete that set: set name is still visible in windows header
-sync of changed saved set does not update title on target machine
-creating a new clone does not generate appearance setting events for sync
-Related: create a new cardtype through *.cards import, setting font, does not 
 seem to sync across?
-if the sync changed the appearance settings, the current card's question still
 shows the old appearance
-sync failed because of version mismatch seems to result in requirement for 
 full sync?
-note: sync from a to b and then to c adds latex files to the media table. Is 
 this aproblem? Can the table become corrupt?
-heartbeat in headless server: if a sync request comes in while this is running,
 it will fail because of threading issues.
-Michael Campbell: I changed the background color of Mnemosyne to something 
 other than white, and I noticed that it uses that color when adding new 
 content. However, when that window does not have focus, it turns white again.
-tag on client, same tag on server, then sync. 
 Tag names get renamed, but original tag is set inactive.
-cloze deletion in combination with latex or html does not pick up any open
 environments
-don't switch to text entry field when changing card type with the keys. 
-when the server thread hangs and the main program is terminated, the cleanup
 code gets called from the main thread as opposed to from the server thread,
 and will therefore fail. (The server thread should release its connection
 itself)
-if last card had unequal split, learn ahead of schedule message does not go
 back to 50/50 split.
-webserver: map card type does not really hide the question box, just blanks the
 question 
-corner case: If M > 0 and k < 0 then (a,b) is a local maximum
If M > 0 and k > 0 then (a,b) is a local minimum: eats < ... > 
-move button group in review widget to designer code after pyqt upgrade.
 Also possible in add cards?
*These were all reported using Qt4, and probably no longer apply:
-Qt bug? different font size in edit box and in css
-Qt bug? Cannot restore scroll_to column in card browser after tag rename.
-Qt bug? Cntl+a select all in card browser only selects all the prefetched 
 entries
-Qt bug? insertAtTop on tags combobox in add_cards does not seem to work
-Qt bug? cursor is always black, also on a black background

-Qt bug? review widget: frame.scroll does not seem to work reliably for PageUp
-Qt bug? preview dialog does not pass on keypressevents it does not handle
-Qt bug? QGraphicsWebView.loadFinished sometimes fires before images are loaded?
-Qt bug? bulleted lists: bullets are always aligned left, not centered:
Milesteiner
<ul><li>Focuses 20 to 30cm away</li>
  <li>Eyes wander and occasionally cross</li>
</ul>
-Qt bug? text + linebreak + video + linebreak + text2 does not show text2
-Qt bug? Windows titles not shown?
-Qt bug? When setting Arial as initial font to the FontDialog, it is always
 made bold.
-Qt bug? In default_criterion_widget, need to reinitialise text of label
-Qt bug? When installing the translator, need to reset window title manually.
-Qt bug? keypressEvent for 'yet to learn' works for enter, return, y, but not
 0 or 1.
-Qt bug? main_widget.set_window_title seems to work only if no title was
 defined in the ui file.
-Qt bug? cannot define sq escape character to search for literal _
-Qt bug? Kanji does not scale, but latin does
  åŽ³é‡?ã?ªè­¦æˆ’<span style="font-size:24pt;">test åŽ³é‡?ã?ªè­¦æˆ’</span>
-Qt bug
1. Add new card
2. Enter "test" on front
3. Enter "« test »" (alt+174, alt+175) on back
The card gets closed the moment one has hit the alt+..5 key and a new card is
created with just the "»" symbol.
-Qt bug: enabling word wrap on tag label breaks setting of stretch factors in 
 q and a
-Qt issue: toggling a tag in the card browser using 'space' does not update the
 card list. Catched itemChanged instead of itemClicked would solve this in
 theory, but this would cause a lot of spurious updates if you toggle the parent
 of a big hierarchy. ItemActivated only seems to catch double clicks
-Qt issue: font size is rounded up to the nearest default integer in font 
 selection dialog.
-component_manager:deactivate_all: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-52988  
-tag browser editor of tag names does not capture focus out event, so card 
 count is not redrawn.
-Qt performance problem with selectRow

-grep through TODO's in source code
-flake8
 
 
Features:

-first doing a count and then the actual a query is not a good idea:? 
time 'number_of_log_entries_to_sync_for' vs 'number_of_log_entries'

-don't generate card edited logs when importing a card and no change occurs 
 in a card
  #if (eval(log_entry["extra"]) == orig_card.extra_data) && \
  # tags, unless extra tags on import
  # card type
  # factview		   
  # Important: fact, 
media, tag (check all 'already_imported' statements)

-merging cards: should give an option to go back and edit?

-add login to webserver?
 
-clickable links in card browser (difficult, as after drawing Q or A, only the 
 bitmap is saved,not the browser widget)
 
-settings in config.py don't play well with syncing: if the user does not 
 update config.py on the target machine as well, these settings will get reset
 by the default config.py there. So, get rid of config.py and move it to an 
 advanced settings plugin?

-activate cards: 'having any of these tags:' is not aligned with tag with tag 
 tree
 
-command line switch for headless server not to check for updated card types. 

-option to move dividers in edit field (e.g. for large font sizes)

-for the sentence card type without hints, use the 'meaning' font for Q in 
 production, instead of the sentence font?

-optimisation: change card type for many facts which calls
 'delete_facts_and_their_data' does checking for unused tags multiple times.
 
-fine tuning: when merging a database, merge also the 'active' tag instead of 
 just looking at the deactivated fact views? Probably more general and also 
 more future proof in case of new criteria.

-menu option to copy database to USB key?

-Database locking mechanism can be circumvented if the first Mnemosyne copy 
 is in the browser (or apparently has just done file-new) (Scott Youngman)

-do honour delete media events under sync, by checking if there are no later 
 'added_media' events with the same file.

-when converting f2b to map through the card browser 'change card type',
 check if it's at all possible to convert (enough fields), before showing
 correspondence dialog.
