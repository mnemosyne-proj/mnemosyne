    """A card has a question and an answer and also stores repetition data.

    Questions and answers are dynamically generated depending on the card
    type. Different render chains are supported, to e.g. render the question
    for use in the review window, in the card browser, ... .

    Creation and modification dates are POSIX timestamps stored as integers.

    For card types which need extra information (e.g. cloze deletion), the
    variable 'extra_data' can be used to store this extra information in the
    database. It's dictionary which should contain only standard Python
    objects.

    'scheduler_data' is a variable that can be used by a scheduler to save
    state. It is an integer as opposed to a complex datatype to to allow for
    fast sql queries. If a scheduler needs additional data, it can be stored
    in 'extra_data', but then the custom scheduler needs to make sure it
    explicitly logs an 'edited_card' event so that 'extra data' gets sent
    across during sync.

    'active' is used to determine whether a card is included in the review
    process. Currently, the UI allows setting cards as active if they belong to
    certain card type/fact view combos. We choose to store this information on
    card level and not as a flag in fact view or tag, so that plugins have the
    possibility to offer more flexibility, e.g. by having cards active based
    on grade, ...

    'id' is used to identify this object to the external world (logs, xml
    files, sync, ...), whereas '_id' is an internal id that could be different
    and that can be used by the database for efficiency reasons.

        seen in the acquisition phase (grade 0 and 1) and the retention phase
