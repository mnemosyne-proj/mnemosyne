-Truncate retention score at 100% for non-week long graphs (Dan Schmidt).
-Don't automatically replace newlines with <br> when tags like table tags,
 ul or latex are present (reported by Gnome, abakus0816)
-fix regression for not remembering last shown statictics page (reported by
 Dan Schmidt)
-Fixes for some configuration settings which were not saved.
-Upgraded PyQt on Windows.
-Fixes for cards containing multiple mp3 files (reported Patrick de Metz).
-Made sync more robust.
-Tweaked scheduler to prevent shrinking intervals (reported by Dan Schmidt).
-Reworded 'Getting started' wizard a bit (suggested by Kent Stearman).
-Text properties like fonts are now also applied in user-defined html tables
 (reported by Gnome and Sam S.).
-A user-defined html table no longer uses the same css style as the table
 used by mnemosyne to center the card content. This means that user defined
 tables no longer expand to the full width by default (reported by Gnome).
-Don't allow drag and drop on question or answer field and disable the
 popup menu there (reported by Gnome).
-Only automatically import 1.x databases from the standard location
 reported by Scott Youngman).
-Fix for displaying Cloze cards in the card browser (reported by Roel
 De Coninck).
-Correctly set mediadir if a database is created outside of Mnemosyne's
 datadir (reported by Cyril Frei).
-Recreate media and latex dir if they get deleted after the database has been
 created (reported by Cyril Frei).
-make sure 'Learn ahead of schedule' button text does not revert to
 'Show answer' after opening the configuration dialog (reported by Cyril
 Frei).
-fixed timezone bug (Tim Bourke, Murray James Morrison).
-added about dialog.
-do not allow creating a set without any cards (requested by Troy Guze).


MNEMOSYNE 2.0

More than three years in the making, this is essentially a complete rewrite of
the old 1.x codebase, with a new, clean design, consisting of components that
can be swapped in and out very easily, which allows plugin writers maximum
flexibility.

Major user-visible changes:

-Support for what is called card types. The main user visible changes are that
 editing a vice versa card or three sided card will automatically update the
 related card. There is also support for N-sided cards.
-Whereas in Mnemosyne 1.x, a card could belong to only one category, now a
 card can have multiple tags. Tags can also be organised in a hierachy, with
 '::' separating the levels of the hierachy.
-Powerful new card browser, giving much more information and flexibility to
 organise your cards.
-'Activate cards' is completely revamped and is much more flexible. Also, sets
 of active cards can be now be saved for easier access later.
-Graphical statistics, easily extensible through plugins (first
 implementation by Mike Appleby).
-Each individual field in a card can now have its own font, colour, ... which
 can be set through the GUI. No more need for hacks like 'increase size of
 non-latin characters'. Background colour is also configurable per card type.
-The widget that displays the cards is now a full webbrowser, with e.g.
 support for Javascript, animated gifs, ... .
-Added cramming scheduler plugin, which goes through your cards in random
 order and does not affect the normal scheduler data. It is visually
 distinguished from the regular scheduler by having only two grade buttons
 (Right and Wrong).
-Sync protocol, to synchronise a mobile device to your desktop client. Fully
 bidirectional, i.e. you can add new cards on your desktop and review old
 cards on your phone, and both sets of changes will be merged seamlessly.
 Can sync with more than 1 partner. Optimised for speed and memory useage
 on mobile devices. First implementation by Ed Bartosh and Max Usachev.
-Mnemosyne comes with a webserver to do remote reviews over a browser. It is
 not yet integrated in the GUI, you need to run the 'mnemosyne-webserver'
 program. It also has no security yet.

Other changes:

-Move from Qt3 to Qt4 as GUI toolkit, which has better performance and
 eliminates many interface quirks.
-Move to SQL as the storage backend, resulting in improved speed and memory
 usage, as well as better scalability for large decks (first implementation
 by Ed Bartosh).
-Added card type for maps, and for cloze deletion.
-Plugins can now be turned on and off through the GUI.
-Windows use scroll bar when the data does not fit.
-Vhen importing a sound or an image, a copy is made to the
 .mnemosyne directory. This saves some confusing explaining to new users about
 the difference between relative and absolute paths.
-Mnemosyne can now save after each reviewed card. Default is to only save after
 10 reps, to save battery.
-Avoid showing the same card twice in a row during review.
-Added option "learn new related cards in same session".
-Replaced 'number of grade 0 cards to hold in your hand' by 'number of non
 memorised cards to hold in your hand', so that the limit now works on the
 total of grade 0 and 1 cards. Default value is 10.
-Warn if the user memorises over 15 new cards in a session.
-The keyboard shortcuts for the reviewing process no long auto-repeat.
-Hooked up the machinery to allow embedding video in cards, but on my machine
 only the sound plays. Hopefully, later versions of Qt will fix this.
-Added option to control whether media (sound/video) gets started automatically
 when displaying a card.
-Added option to display a media control (play/pause/slider)
-Improved backup scheme. Users can now restore from backups using the
 File - Open menu, as opposed to first decompressing a file outside of
 Mnemosyne.
-Importing from xml files has been sped up considerably (Johannes Baiter)
-The learing history is now stored in an SQL database, allowing to calculate
 more statistics.
-The plugin mechanism encompasses also the statistics, configuration and card
 activation screens.
-Cards which are failed during learning ahead are now periodically brought
 back in the learning process.
-Mnemosyne now stores its data in a more standards compliant location:
 C:/Users/peter/Application Data/Mnemosyne2 under Windows, and
 /home/pbienst/.local/share/mnemosyne2 and /home/pbienst/.config/mnemosyne2
 under Linux.
-When leaving the program open overnight, the display will update at the
 roll over point.
-Intelligent sorting of categories containing numbers, so that you no longer
 have to call a category 'Lesson 01' instead of 'Lesson '1 to get the correct
 ordering (Mike Appleby).
-Uses Phonon as sound backend instead of PyGame (Louis Cyphre).

-Fix problems with missing locale under some unix systems.
-Fix hang under Spanish translation.
-Danish translation by Randi H.
-Esperanto translation by jchthys.
-Updated Japanese translation by Patrick Kenny.


MNEMOSYNE 1.2 : 2008-11-25

-Improved support for unicode in filenames and directories.
-Reverted compression of backups from gz to bz2 again, to circumvent a
 bug under Windows with unicode directory names.
-Wrote a plugin to always shuffle the revision queue, for users who want
 to override the prioritised scheduling introduced in Mnemosyne 1.1.
 This plugin can also be downloaded from
 http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/node/142
-Only open the sound system when needed in order to save CPU time
 (patch by marmuta).
-More robust upgrading from old Mnemosyne versions.

 the next week.
-Norwegian translation by Petter Goksoyr Asen.


MNEMOSYNE 1.1.1 : 2008-08-23

Databases opened by this version of Mnemosyne will no longer work under
older versions.

-Fixed 'learn new cards in random order' problem for imported cards (reported
 by Adam McCaughan).

 cards to hold in your hand' (suggested by Kenneth Murphy).
-Updated Czech translation by Jiri Popelka and Petr Tomica.
-Updated Japanese translation by Patrick Kenny.


MNEMOSYNE 1.1 : 2008-07-26

-Added statistics for the current card to the statistics window.
-More features for plugin writers. Arbitrary code can now be run after the
 database is loaded, as well as code to intercept and modify question and
 answer strings before they are displayed. There is a plugin directory in
 the source distribution with examples, e.g. to activate all the categories
 on startup, or to add the last grade to the answer text, or to add a new
 import file format (CSV in this case), or to create custom tags and run
 its contents in an external program.
-New cards can either be learned in random order or in the order that they
 were added (configurable through the GUI).
-Prioritise cards forgotten during the review over cards which have not yet
 been committed to long-term memory.
-Improved scheduling of overdue cards, by placing those with a shorter
 interval first. Being a day late on an interval of 2 could be much worse
 than being a day late on an interval of 50.
-Fix some keyboard shortcut quirks (reported by Stephen Boulet and varkhan1).
-Removed pyxml dependency. This fixes the "'module' object has no attribute
 'DefaultHandler'" error message on Ubuntu (Albert Damen).

 Bourke).
-Added support for Mac installer through py2app (Konrad Wojas).
-On OSX, Mnemosyne now stores its data in Library/Mnemosyne (Konrad Wojas).
-Added <protect>...</protect> tags. Text within these tags will not be
 touched by 'increase size of non-latin characters' (Konrad Wojas).
-Changed compression format of the backups from bz2 to gz. This results in
 less compression, but a much faster program exit (suggested by Konrad Wojas).
-Added midi files to "import sound" file dialog (suggested by Johan Forsberg).
-Polish translation by Tomasz Nazarenko.
-Japanese translation by Patrick Kenny.
-Persian translation by Bahman Eslami.
-Brazilian Portugese translation by Fabio Kreusch.
-Make dvipng invocation more robust. Especially helpful for Ubuntu users.
 (Thanks to Stephen Boulet and franny1).
-Fixed bug where day_starts_at was not working (Konrad Wojas).

-Make XML import from svgtoquiz more robust (bug reported by Mercado1).



MNEMOSYNE 1.0.1.1 : 2008-03-22

-Disabled making grade 0 the keyboard default for cards with previous
 grades 0 or 1, as a (Py)Qt bug seems to make it unreliable under Windows
 (reported by Bernhard Blum).


MNEMOSYNE 1.0.1 : 2008-03-16

-Make grade 0 the keyboard default for cards with previous grades 0 or 1.
-Add support for html style escaped unicode in txt import, to allow import
 of Supermemo databases containing unicode (requested by Patrick Kenny).

 Patrick Kenny).
-Added new option in config.py (day_starts_at) to be able to change the
 moment a new day starts (requested by Patrick Kenny).
-On Windows, log errors to a file in the user's directory, as opposed to a
 file in a system directory (requested by nairbv).
-Visually distinguish grades 0 and 1 from other grades (based on input
 from Juan Alonso and Mike Charlton.)
-Czech translation (cs) by Jiri Popelka and Petr Tomica.
-Chinese translation (zh_CN, zh_HK, zh_SG, zh_TW) by Leon Goo.
-French translation (fr) by Jamshid Bahar.


MNEMOSYNE 1.0 : 2007-12-27

(Note that for Windows users we recommend uninstalling the previous
version before doing an upgrade.)

-Mnemosyne can now be run from a USB drive. Copy the Mnemosyne directory
 from C:\Program Files to your USB drive, and then copy the .mnemosyne
 directory from inside your home directory to inside the Mnemosyne directory
 on the USB drive. Alternatively, you can start mnemosyne with the -d option
 to specify where .mnemosyne directory is located, e.g.
   F:\Mnemosyne\mnemosyne.exe -d F:\.mnemosyne

 To run the Linux version from a USB key, untar the source file
 mnemosyne-X.X.tgz (with X.X the version number) to the USB key. Copy your
 .mnemosyne directory to the USB key as well. Change to the directory where
 the USB key is mounted and type

 PYTHONPATH=mnemosyne-X.X python mnemosyne-X.X/mnemosyne/pyqt_ui/mnemosyne -d .

 (This assumes that the system you are working on has Python installed, as
 well as all the libraries Mnemosyne requires.)
-new logo, thanks to a contributor whose name sadly got lost in the
 demise of the open-collab site.
-new icons, based on the Crystal iconset.
-added tip of the day wizard.
-implemented a basic plugin system. The directory .mnemosyne/plugins
 can contain Python scripts which will be executed at run time and
 which can be used to customise Mnemosyne or add new features.
-when importing from tab separated txt files, the presence of 3 columns
 on a line gives results in the import of 3-sided cards (written form /
 pronunciation / translation).
-choosing 'reset learning data' on export now preserves the relationship
 between cards (for e.g. inverses and three-sided cards).
-automatically back up the database to XML on exit. The last five backups
 are kept in .mnemosyne/backup.
-support for multiple sound tags per field (requested by compiu).
-removed a few rarely used options from the configuration dialog and
 placed them in .mnemosyne/config.py, a new file which can be used to
 set these and other rarely used options.
-increase the maximum value of 'increase size of non-latin characters'
 to 200 (requested by Mike Charlton).
-make 'increase size of non-latin characters' more robust (Nils Kriha).
 Previously, not all values of this setting would result in a visible
 change.
-don't count inactive cards in the grade distribution in the statistics
 window (reported by Joonatan Kaartinen).
-add support for translations. (German translation provided by Martin Mueller,
 Spanish by Daniel Alvarez Wise and Juan Alonsa, Dutch by Edwin de Jong)
 The translation will be chosen automatically based on your system's
 localisation, but can be overridden by editing the 'locale' variable in
 .mnemosyne/config.py.
-improved tooltips.
-added desktop file, so that Mnemosyne shows up in the application menu
 under Linux.
-more verbose error messages when an import failed, showing the line that
 failed to parse.
-log uploading now works if a proxy is needed to access the web.
-added support for Unicode filenames.
-recreate user id from history folder in case the config file was
 accidentally deleted.
-don't exit when final save failed (requested by lebowski_404).
-added more supported sound and picture formats.
-don't stumble over (invalid) unicode in latex commands (reported by Tomek
 Guzialek).
-fixed 'Save as' option.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.10 : 2007-10-28

-added 3-sided cards, to make dealing with vocabulary in foreign scripts
 easier. Right clicking the text field in 'add cards' gives you to option
 to switch to 3-sided card input, which replaces the question and answer
 fields by 3 fields: written form, pronunciation, translation. After
 selecting an initial grade, 2 cards will be added:

  Q: written form
  A: pronunciation
     translation

 and

  Q: translation
  A: written form
     pronunciation

-when creating multiple cards from the same data (either through add vice
 versa or the 3-sided input), the relationship between these cards is now
 stored. In a future version, this will make it possible that editing one
 card of the set automatically updates the other ones.
-added feature to insert an image or a sound tag by using a file selector.
 Accessed through popup-menu or keyboard shortcuts.
-remember more settings across invocations: file formats and directories,
 reset learning data, column width and sorting order, ...
-rationalised keyboard shortcuts and menus. Added list of keyboard shortcuts
 to the website.
-polished file dialogs.
-when possible, paths in the config file are now saved relative to the
 .mnemosyne directory rather than as absolute paths. This makes it easier
 to copy the .mnemosyne directory back and forth between a Linux and a
 Windows machine.
-respect duplicate handling configuration options when importing (reported
 by lebowski_404).
-latex output and error messages are now written to the file
 .mnemosyne/latex/latex_out.txt rather than to the screen, so that they
 are not lost for Windows users.
-fixed bug when showing the statistics for an empty database (reported by
 Gintautas Miliauskas).


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.9 : 2007-08-16

-added 'Show statistics' menu option, showing the schedule for the
 next week, the distribution of the items over the grades and the number
 of items for each category.
-added simple per-item statistics in pop-up menu in 'edit items'.
-performance improvements.
-new latex tags, based on code by Christopher Gilbreth and bug reports by
 Jamned:
   -<$>...</$>         : for inline equations
   -<$$>...</$$>       : for centered equations on a separate line
   -<latex>...</latex> : for latex code not in a certain environment
 This means that the functionality of the old <latex>...</latex> tags is
 now taken over by <$>...</$>. However, there is no need to update your
 items, as you can rely on the following new feature:
-don't abort on small latex errors which the latex interpreter can fix
 itself (like missing $) (requested by S. Scharrer).
-the preamble and postamble used when processing the latex tags can now
 be customised by editing the files 'preamble' and 'postamble' in
 <home dir>/.mnemosyne/latex.
-the command invoking dvipng to create images from latex can now be
 customised by editing the file 'dvipng' in <home dir>/.mnemosyne/latex
-remember category and vice-versa settings across invocations when adding
 items.
-add maximise button to add and edit items under Windows (thanks to
 pizzasource and S. Scharrer).
-respect setting 'number of grade 0 items to learn at once' to zero
 (reported by pizzasource).
-fix word wrap when using left alignment (reported by TomC).
-don't abort when sound initialisation fails.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.8.1: 2007-04-23

-fix scheduling bug when importing new grade 0 items (reported by Jim
Slattery).
-remove incorrect statement with respect to grade 2 behaviour from the
manual. In 0.9.8, the code was changed to be consistent with the old
manual. This has been reverted, so that grade 2 behaviour is again more
like 0.9.7.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.8: 2007-04-13

-added sound support through tags like <sound src="a.wav">. The path to
 the sound file is either absolute or relative to the location of your
 .mem file. To play the sound again, press the 'R' key in the main window.
 Supported file formats are wav, ogg and mp3. On Linux, this requires
 properly installing pygame and its dependencies like SDL.
-add option to increase size of non-latin characters relative to latin
 characters (together with N. Kriha).
-disable 'edit item' as long as the answer is not shown, to prevent
 accidentally revealing it (patch by D. Herrmann).
-fix handling of < inside latex tags (reported by jgurling, patch by N.
 Kriha).
-warn when exiting an 'Add items' which contains an item which has not
 been added (requested by Airconditioning).
-fix UTF-8 handling in the Supermemo7 file format (reported by Loco)
-fix corner cases in scheduling algorithm (patch by Querido).
-make button ordering more consistent in add items (reported by N. Kriha).
-fixed handling of multiple latex tags (reported by M. Boespflug).
-don't hang on latex errors (reported by M. Boespflug).
-make tab-separated import resistant to the presence of multiple tabs
 (reported by J. Forrez).
-fixed hang when end quotes are not present inside a tag.
-fixed regression where the active flag of categories was not respected on
 import (reported by A. Rachmatullah).
-respect left align option in 'preview items' (reported by E. Grannan).
-making saving more robust while Windows is shutting down (fix by Tom).
-various small interface cleanups and fixes.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.7: 2006-10-27

-multiple items can now be selected in the 'edit items' dialog in order
 to delete them, change their categories, or add their vice versas.
-added option to import text files where question and answer are each on
 their own line.
-again respect window size set by user.
-make delete button work in 'edit items' dialog (reported by J. Forrez).
-worked around oddity (extra first character in text file) when importing
 Word unicode text files.
-various small interface cleanups and fixes.
-updated documentation on the website.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.6: 2006-10-07

-added LaTeX support for formulas, e.g. <latex>x^2+y^2=z^2</latex>. For
 this you need latex and dvipng installed. Windows users can download
 MiKTeX. (thanks to input from Henrik Skov Midtiby and J. David Lee.)
-added possibility to preview an item. Useful if you work with tags.
-added import from SuperMemo7 text files (code thanks to Dirk Herrmann).
-either space, enter or return can be used to show the answer. The default
 answer grade is set to 4, which once again can be chosen by either space,
 enter or return (patch by Dirk Herrmann).
-importing of txt files in utf8 unicode encoding now works (patch by Ian
 MacLean).
-exporting to txt files now uses utf8 encoding.
-the total number of items in the status bar now only takes into account
 items in active categories (patch by Mike Charlton).
-prevent infinite recursion when searching for an item that was recently
 deleted.
-the titlebar now displays unicode filenames correctly.
-after the window expands to accomodate a large item, it will shrink
 back again.
-fixed incorrect button text when switching databases.
-new grade 0/1 items will now be scheduled after existing grade 0/1 items.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.5: 2006-08-03

*** IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE ***

This version uses a different database format. Before upgrading, export your
old data as xml. After upgrade, create a new database and import the old data
from the xml file.

-databases can now be moved back and forth between Windows and Unix.
-added 'Reset learning data on export' option. This makes it easier to
 create a file to share with other people.
-the database is now saved each time a new item is added.
-fixed a bug where exporting to txt always exported all categories
 (reported by Dariusz Laska).
-items which you forget will no longer be pushed out of the revision queue
 by items which you still need to learn.


MNEMOSYNE 0.9.4: 2006-06-04

- category names are now sorted alphabetically.
- relative path names now work for multiple img tags in the same string.
  (patch by J. David Lee).
- removed leftover debug code which could cause problems with Unicode
  items.

MNEMOSYNE 0.9.3: 2006-05-25

- relative paths can now be used in img tags, i.e. <img src="foo/bar.png">
  instead of <img src="/home/johndoe/.mnemosyne/foo/bar.png">. Paths are
  relative to the location of the *.mem file.
- added ability to export to a txt file (only the questions and the
  answers are exported).
- added locking mechanism which warns you if you start a second
  instance of the program, which could lead to data loss.
- fixed obscure button labelling bug (patch by J. David Lee).

MNEMOSYNE 0.9.2: 2006-03-25

*** IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTICE ***

This version uses a different database format. Before upgrading, export your
old data as xml. After upgrade, create a new database and import the old data
from the xml file.

- only a limited number of grade 0 items is moved to the learning queue
  at a single time. This is 5 by default, but can be set through the
  configuration screen
- added ability to import from tab separated text files (as exported e.g.
  by Excel)
