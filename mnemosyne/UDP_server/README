The only relevant file to study when writing a new client based on the UDP 
server is 'example_client.py', which shows how to interact with libmnemosyne
through UDP.

Obviously, 'example_client.py' needs to be reimplemented in your language of
choice, and all the callbacks which are now simple print statements need to be
fleshed out as well.
