INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE:

1) LINUX

First install the following dependencies:

-Python 3.5 or later (http://www.python.org)
-PyQt 5.6 or later
 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download, which boils
 down to 'sudo pip3 install PyQt5').
-If you want to be able to enter formulas using latex syntax, make sure
 that latex and dvipng are installed.
-Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
-EasyInstall (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall)
-CherryPy 3.2 or later (http://www.cherrypy.org)
-Webob 1.4 or later (http://webob.org)

To actually install mnemosyne:
-Extraxt the .tar.gz file and change to its root directory (i.e.
 probably the directory where you found this README file).
-Type 'python3 setup.py install' as root.

To test the installation:
-Change to any other directory e.g. by typing 'cd ~'.
-Run the application by typing 'mnemosyne'.

If you run into the issue of non-latin characters not displaying on statistic
plots, install ttf-mscorefonts-installer and regenerate the font cache of
matplotlib.

2) MAC OS/X

 -Download and install Homebrew (see http://brew.sh)
 -Open the Terminal.
 -Make sure you are using the latest version of Homebrew:

     brew update
    
 -Install the dependencies for Mnemosyne.
 
     brew install python3 qt5 pyqt5 mplayer
     pip3 install webob tornado matplotlib numpy sip pillow
     # https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1874
     pip3 install git+git://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller.git@5812b64470e2232f6b6f8f68c81dc220b2aedfd7
 
 -Build it:
 
     export PYTHON=python3
     export QT5DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt5 # help pyinstaller find the qt5 path
     make clean
     make osx

 -Test the new application (back up your data directory first!):

     open dist/Mnemosyne.app

 -and optionally drag and drop this new app to /Applications
