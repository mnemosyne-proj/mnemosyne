* Download and install PythonCE or PythonCE smartphone:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104228

* Copy the directories ppygui and mnemosyne (containing libmnemosyne
  and ppygui_ui to \My Device\Program Files\Python25\Lib\site-packages

* Copy the updated version of the sqlite library sqlite3.dll
  (provided by tdhite) to \My Device\Program Files\Python25\
  You might need to activate 'Show All Files' in the filemanager menu
  for this

* Copy your .mnemosyne directory to your storage card, e.g. to
  \SDMMC\.mnemosyne

* Edit the basedir variable inside Mnemosyne Mobile.py to give 
  the location where your .mnemosyne directory will be stored. 
  In our example, this is \SDMMC\.mnemosyne

* Optionally, copy Mnemosyne Mobile.py to 
  \My Device\Windows\Start Menu\Programs for easier access. 

* The very first startup will be slower since all the code needs to be
  byte-compiled. This will only happen once.

* To synchronise your data with a desktop machine, it's best to
  synchronise the *entire* .mnemosyne directory, and not just your
  database (otherwise you will lose statistics information). There
  are external tools to make this easier (like Unison).

* Note that to save resources, no backups are made on the mobile version,
  so it is recommended to sync with a desktop from time to time.

* If you click the close button on the top right of the screen,
  Mnemosyne and Python will still keep running in the background. The
  only way to really close them is to go to 
  Settings / System / Memory / Running Programs

* If you've 'lost' your Mnemosyne window, e.g. by having looked at the
  Today screen, you cannot reactivate it by clicking on the Mnemosyne
  program icon again, but you need to reactivate it in
  Settings / System / Memory / Running Programs

* Although this not marked visually by a border, the focus is on the 
  button that makes most sense to press at each stage (show answer, or grade
  0 for an unlearned card, and grade 4 for a learned card). This facilitates
  one-handed operation.

* Note: tapping on the screen results in much faster operation than pushing
  buttons, at least on my device (This has nothing to do with Mnemosyne and 
  happens with other applications too)
