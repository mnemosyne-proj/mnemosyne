INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE:

1) LINUX

First install the following dependencies:

-Python 3.5 or later (http://www.python.org)
-PyQt 5.6 or later
 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download, which boils
 down to 'sudo pip3 install PyQt5').
-If you want to be able to enter formulas using latex syntax, make sure
 that latex and dvipng are installed.
-Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
-EasyInstall (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall)
-cheroot 5 or later (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Cheroot/, 
 pip3 install cheroot)
-Webob 1.4 or later (http://webob.org)
-PIL (https://python-pillow.org, pip3 install pillow)

To actually install mnemosyne:
-Extraxt the .tar.gz file and change to its root directory (i.e.
 probably the directory where you found this README file).
-Type 'python3 setup.py install' as root.

To test the installation:
-Change to any other directory e.g. by typing 'cd ~'.
-Run the application by typing 'mnemosyne'.

If you run into the issue of non-latin characters not displaying on statistic
plots, install ttf-mscorefonts-installer and regenerate the font cache of
matplotlib.

2) macOS

 - Download and install Homebrew (see http://brew.sh)
 - Open the Terminal.
 - Make sure you are using the latest version of Homebrew:

     brew update

 - Patch the python3 formula so you'll get python 3.5 and not a later version (pyinstaller still requires python 3.5):

     brew uninstall python3
     brew edit python3
     # replace the file with the contents of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/1e62c645b2fc2d82042d9f7c364c6a246f2e11ed/Formula/python3.rb and save it
     brew install python3
     brew pin python3
    
 - Install the dependencies for Mnemosyne. You may need to install qt5 or python3 manually to get the correct version.
 
     brew install qt@5.7 mplayer
     pip3 install virtualenv
     virtualenv --python=python3 venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip3 install webob tornado matplotlib numpy sip pillow cheroot pyqt5 pyinstaller
 
 - Build it:
 
     export PYTHON=python3
     export QT5DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt@5.7 # help pyinstaller find the qt5 path
     make clean
     make osx

 - Test the new application (back up your data directory first!):

     open dist/Mnemosyne.app

 - and optionally drag and drop this new app to /Applications
